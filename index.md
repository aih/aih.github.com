Welcome
=======

This is a small experiment in Github pages.  This seems like a powerful model for writing blog content, and I want to try out both publishing with git, and writing with Markdown.

For example, this is a simple list:
1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item

Emphasizing text is **easy**, as is using _italics_, though I'm not sure how to create bold text if I want to.

It is unclear how some features will be transformed, however...

This works to set the level of header:
# First level
## Second level
# First again
# Last item in the list

And this creates different levels of a list:

+ First level
++ Second level
+ First again
+ Last item in the list
